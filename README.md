QueueBuddy is a swift iOS app that helps bring fairness to music at parties. 
It allows one user to host a session that others can join and queue music from. 
This allows one main device to be connected to the speaker but control the music from many phones.

This project was my first full swift project and I wanted to not only get functionality but also get the modern iOS UI looking good.
